# Project Progress Report

_Last updated: 2025-04-29_

## Overview
This document summarizes the current implementation status, architecture, and key features of the Grocery Store Accounting Web Application (Laravel-based, Pakistan localization).

---

## 1. Core Features Implemented
- **Double-entry bookkeeping**: All transactions generate journal entries and are linked to Chart of Accounts.
- **Unique reference codes**: Transactions (e.g., invoices) use unique codes (e.g., INV-000001).
- **Localization**: Supports Pakistani Rupees and grocery-specific measurement units.
- **User system**: Owner (super admin) and staff roles, with permissions managed via Laravel Policies/Gates.
- **Live search and Fine Table style**: All major tables use a modern, responsive UI with AJAX search, pagination, and modular Blade partials.

---

## 2. Main Modules & Controllers
- **Vendors**: `VendorController.php`, `VendorLedgerController.php`, Vendor CRUD, and ledger view.
- **Customers**: `CustomerController.php`, `CustomerLedgerController.php`, Customer CRUD, and ledger view.
- **Purchases**: `PurchaseController.php`, `PurchasesController.php`, purchase flows, and integration with vendors.
- **Sales**: `SaleController.php`, `SalesController.php`, sales flows, and integration with customers.
- **Expenses**: `ExpenseController.php`, `ExpensesController.php`, expense accounts, and ledgers.
- **Inventory**: `InventoryController.php`, `InventoryCategoryController.php`, inventory management.
- **Banking**: `BankController.php`, `BankLedgerController.php`, bank accounts, and transfers.
- **Payments/Receipts**: `VendorPaymentController.php`, `CustomerReceiptController.php`, payment/receipt flows.
- **Reports**: `ReportsController.php` and dedicated services for all major financial reports.
- **Stock Adjustments**: `StockAdjustmentController.php`, inventory corrections.
- **User Management**: `UsersController.php`, `ProfileController.php`.

---

## 5. Services

## 6. Blade Views & UI
