## Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Setup & Chart of Accounts
- **Migrations:**
  - `chart_of_accounts` (with code, name, type, nature, parent, etc.)
  - `journal_entries` (entry_number, date, description, reference)
  - `journal_entry_lines` (journal_entry_id, account_id, debit, credit, description)
- **Models:** ChartOfAccount, JournalEntry, JournalEntryLine
- **Logic:**
  - All transactions post to journal_entries and lines
  - Relationships: ChartOfAccount hasMany JournalEntryLines; JournalEntry hasMany JournalEntryLines

### Phase 2: Master Data (Products, Units, Categories)
- **Migrations:**
  - `products`, `units`, `product_categories`
- **Models:** Product, Unit, ProductCategory
- **Logic:**
  - Opening balances for products create journal entries
  - Relationships: Product belongsTo Unit & Category

### Phase 3: Purchases
- **Migrations:**
  - `purchases`, `purchase_items`, `vendors`
- **Models:** Purchase, PurchaseItem, Vendor
- **Logic:**
  - Observer auto-creates journal entries on purchase
  - Handles discounts, payment status (Paid/Credit), payment account
  - Relationships: Vendor hasMany Purchases; Purchase hasMany PurchaseItems

### Phase 4: Sales
- **Migrations:**
  - `customers`, `sales`, `sale_items`
- **Models:** Customer, Sale, SaleItem
- **Logic:**
  - Observer auto-creates journal entries on sale
  - Handles discounts, payment status, payment account
  - Relationships: Customer hasMany Sales; Sale hasMany SaleItems

### Phase 5: Customer Receipts
- **Migrations:**
  - `customer_receipts`
- **Models:** CustomerReceipt
- **Logic:**
  - Observer on CustomerReceipt auto-creates journal entry
  - Debits: Cash/Bank; Credits: Customer Account
  - Relationships: Customer hasMany Receipts

### Phase 6: Vendor Payments
- **Migrations:**
  - `vendor_payments`
- **Models:** VendorPayment
- **Logic:**
  - Observer on VendorPayment auto-creates journal entry
  - Debits: Vendor Payables; Credits: Cash/Bank
  - Relationships: Vendor hasMany Payments

### Phase 7: Expense Management
- **Migrations:**
  - `expenses`
- **Models:** Expense
- **Logic:**
  - Observer on Expense auto-creates journal entry
  - Debits: Expense Account; Credits: Cash/Bank

### Phase 8A: Stock Adjustments
- **Migrations:**
  - `stock_adjustments`, `stock_adjustment_items`
- **Models:** StockAdjustment, StockAdjustmentItem
- **Logic:**
  - Observer on StockAdjustment:
    - If Increase: adds to product stock, debits Inventory, credits Inventory Adjustment
    - If Decrease: subtracts from product stock (validates stock), debits Inventory Loss, credits Inventory
    - Journal entry created and linked

### Phase 8B: Financial Reporting
- **Services:**
  - `TrialBalanceReportService`: Opening/closing balances, debits/credits per account
  - `GeneralLedgerReportService`: All entries per account with running balance
  - `JournalReportService`: Lists all journal entries and lines
  - `IncomeStatementService`: Calculates Income, Expenses, Net Profit/Loss (date range)
  - `BalanceSheetReportService`: Asset, Liability, Equity balances as of a date; validates accounting equation
- **Logic:**
  - All reports use journal_entries, journal_entry_lines, chart_of_accounts
  - No UI or routes yet (backend only)

---

## Design Principles
- **Double-entry Bookkeeping:** Every transaction creates balanced journal entries (debits = credits)
- **Observers:** All business logic for accounting events handled via Eloquent observers
- **Traceability:** All financial and inventory events link to journal entries for full audit trail
- **Error Handling:** Clear errors if required accounts are missing or entries are unbalanced
- **Extensibility:** Clean separation of models, observers, and reporting services

---

## Backend-Only Focus
- No user interface or API routes implemented yet
- All logic is in migrations, models, observers, and service classes
- Ready for future UI/API expansion

---

## Additional Notes
- All unique numbers (e.g., INV-000001, VPM-000001, EXP-000001, ADJ-000001) are auto-generated
- All reporting and business logic is localized for Pakistani context (PKR, grocery units, etc.)
- User roles/permissions, localization, and advanced features are planned for future phases
